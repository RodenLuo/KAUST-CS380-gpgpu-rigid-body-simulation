# KAUST CS380 project goal description

1. Understand how does the rigid body simulation work
2. Port the current repo to CUDA
3. Implementate CPU version of the simulaiton
4. Profile the OpenCL, CUDA, and CPU version on Windows, and Linux
5. Implemente a molecular dynamics simulator if time allows

# GPU accelerated rigid body simulation with OpenGL and OpenCL.

## The main features:
* Real time simulation with OpenGL (SDL2) wiev.
* Real time Ball to Wall, Ball to Box, Ball to Ball collision and refelction.
* GPU Acceleration with OpenCL.
* Live switch between the CPU and GPU implementation.
* GUI and live parametering
* Live camera interaction (Sphere camera rotation)
* Live mouse interaction.

## The envirement:
* The code is platform free and it use free multiplatform libs, but i developed and tested in Winddows.
* This is a Visual studio project (Made with Visual Studio 2019).
* The project need SDL2 OpemCL GLEW IMGUI for compiling.
* This zip file contains the nececcery dependecies. You can mount the dependencies in a T drive with the script in the zip file.
* (https://github.com/SandorBalazsHU/elte-ik-gpgpu-rigid-body-simulation/blob/master/dependencies.zip)
* The Visual studio project configured for this dependecy pack and the T virtual Drive.

## The GUI:
* You can rotate the camera with the mouse, when you hold the left mouse button.
* You can move the small box with the mouse, when you hold the right mouse button.
* You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.
* The main GUI in the left top corner. (The window is replaceable and resizable.)
* Here you can see the FPS meter.
* ---- All setting is live ----
* Then you can set the gravity vector.
* Then you can set the air resistance.
* Then you can set the simulation box size.
* Then you can set the balls number. [1-1500]
* Then you can apply random XZ and Y ball start position. (Works after reset)
* <b>The most importent is the RUN switch. Here you can START/STOP the simulation.</b>
* Then you can switch on/off the ball to ball collision.
* Then you can reinitialise the simulation. (RESET)
* Then you can switch on/off the small box.

## The virtual folders:
* I made virual folders in Visual Studio for the better transparency.
* I used CamelCased names and English comments.

## The Theoretical background:
I stored the balls positions in float3 and their velocities in an another float3 vector.
The new position is the position vector and the velocity vectors sum.
I modelld the gravity vith an another float3 vector and i subtract the velocitiy vector with the gravity vector.
I add an air resistance vector when slow down.

```
    glm::vec3 positions[numberOfBalls];
    glm::vec3 velocities[numberOfBalls];
    float resistance;

    velocities[i] = velocities[i] - gravity;
    velocities[i] = velocities[i] * resistance;
    positions[i]  = positions[i] + velocities[i];
    if (ballCollisionRun) ballCollision(i);
    if(barrierIsOn) barrierCollision(i);
    wallCollision(i);
```

## The ball to Ball Collision (The first way, i used this for GPU):

### Used sources:
* Ball to wall reflection: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/13261/how-to-get-a-reflection-vector
* Ball to wall collision (Way 1): http://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/mechanics/elastic-collisions-in-3d/
* Ball to wall collision (Way 2): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision
* Phisical simulations: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/linear-momentum/elastic-and-inelastic-collisions/a/what-are-elastic-and-inelastic-collisions

## Issues
* When you set 1500 balls the GPU ball to ball collision sometimes becomes unstable (In this case you can switch to CPU and Back.)
* With 1500 balls the average FPS is 20-30.

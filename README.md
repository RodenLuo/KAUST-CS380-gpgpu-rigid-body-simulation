## The main features:
* Real time simulation with OpenGL (SDL2) wiev.
* Real time Ball to Wall, Ball to Box, Ball to Ball collision and refelction.
* GPU Acceleration with OpenCL.
* Live switch between the CPU and GPU implementation.
* GUI and live parametering
* Live camera interaction (Sphere camera rotation)
* Live mouse interaction.
